<h2 id="on-online-mode">On online mode</h2>

<p>I’ve been getting into <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, and I want to play competitively once COVID-19 is over.</p>

<p>The best I can do for now is to play online. However, <em>Ultimate</em>’s online play is notoriously bad:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/14/18140814/super-smash-bros-ultimate-input-lag-latency-feel">The input lag is around 98 ms (~6 frames)</a>, which is on the high end for a fighting game (<a href="http://shoryuken.com/2018/10/19/soulcalibur-vi-input-lag-tested-and-its-comparable-to-street-fighter-v/">the highest listed in this article</a> is <em>Samurai Showdown</em> with 94ms input lag).</li>
  <li>The game uses delay-based netcode instead of rollback-based netcode, which means that inputs are delayed until all participants have acknowledged them, rather than speculatively executed.</li>
  <li>The game uses peer-to-peer connections rather than centralized servers, which means that all parties are punished for a single party’s lag. This is a problem in both one-on-one play and in the Battle Arena format, where many participants may join, and the quality of the game is determined by the worst internet connection. (NB: a peer-to-peer connection can also have theoretically better performance if the route between players is shorter than a given player’s route to the server.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="playing-on-wi-fi">Playing on Wi-Fi</h2>

<p>There’s two main arrangements recommended to combat lag:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a LAN adapter for the Nintendo Switch, rather than relying on Wi-Fi.</li>
  <li>Use a low-latency display (particularly one set to “Game Mode”, if available).</li>
</ul>

<p>I used to play with a LAN adapter on my living room TV, under the assumption that having a wired connection was more important than having a low-latency display. Then I tried playing with my Switch on a small monitor at my work setup over Wi-Fi. What I discovered is that the opposite was true in my case: <strong>having a low-latency display produced better gameplay than having a wired internet connection</strong>.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi can be deployed in one or both of two bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. <a href="https://blog.parsecgaming.com/how-your-wifi-band-impacts-low-latency-connections-9f1e538a63dd">In this article by Parsec</a>, they demonstrate that 5 GHz actually has quite low latency:</p>

<figure class="figure">
        <a href="/preview/pr-49/assets/posts/lan-adapter/wifi-latency.jpeg"><img class="center-image" src="/preview/pr-49/assets/posts/lan-adapter/wifi-latency.jpeg" alt="Graph comparing latencies of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and wired connection." title="Graph comparing latencies of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and wired connection." /></a>
        <figcaption class="caption">
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This diagram indicates the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a baseline, a wired connection has around 1 ms latency.</li>
  <li>2.4 GHz Wi-Fi can have huge spikes in latency, routinely hitting 30 ms in their testing.</li>
  <li>5 GHz reliably stays at around 5 ms latency, and in the worst case, only hits</li>
  <li>about 8 ms latency.</li>
</ul>

<p>So 5 GHz Wi-Fi is definitely worse than a wired connection, but not by much. For context, 8 ms is about half a frame, so it would be barely noticeable in practice.</p>

<p>The display you use also can make a big difference. <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tests/inputs/input-lag">Gaming monitors might have on the order of 10 ms lag</a>. My living room TV is an awful 70-inch Samsung smart TV, and I have nothing but bad things to say about it. Besides smart TVs being inherently bad, this particular TV was not marketed as a gaming display, and it seems to have a huge amount of latency, even with Game Mode enabled.</p>

<p>The difference became noticeable only now that I’m playing at a higher level than before. <a href="https://www.elitegsp.com/">elitegsp.com</a> currently estimates me at the 98th percentile of online players. (My guess is that this would be around the 40th or 50th percentile for in-person players).</p>

<p>After switching to a better monitor, I find I can suddenly react to things I was unable to before. I can catch ledge get-up options more reliably; I’ve started being able to jump over to Samus’s fully-charged charge shots, etc., on reaction, which has never happened before; some of my tight combos even seem more reliable.</p>

<p>So Wi-Fi online play needn’t be that bad!</p>
