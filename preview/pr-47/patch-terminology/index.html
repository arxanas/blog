<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>Q: I am doing research for a source control project, can you answer what the following nouns mean to you in the context of source control, if anything? (Ordered alphabetically)</p>

<ul>
  <li>a “change”</li>
  <li>a “commit”</li>
  <li>a “patch”</li>
  <li>a “revision”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>P1 (Google, uses Piper + CLs):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change: a difference in code. What isn’t committed yet.</li>
  <li>Commit: a cl. Code that is ready to push and has a description along with it</li>
  <li>Patch: a commit number that that someone made that may or may not be pushed yet […] A change that’s not yours</li>
  <li>Revision: a change to a commit?</li>
</ul>

<p>P2 (big tech, uses GitLab + MRs):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change: added/removed/updated files</li>
  <li>Commit: a group of related changes with a description</li>
  <li>Patch: a textual representation of changes between two versions</li>
  <li>Revision: a version of the repository, like the state of all files after a set of commits</li>
</ul>

<p>P3 (Google, uses Fig + CLs):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change: A change to me is any difference in code. Uncommitted to pushed. I’ve heard people say I’ve pushed the change.</li>
  <li>Commit: A commit is a saved code diff with a description.</li>
  <li>Patch: A patch is a diff between any two commits how to turn commit a into into b.</li>
  <li>Revision: Revisions idk. I think at work they are snapshots of a code base so all changes at a point in time.</li>
</ul>

<p>P4 (Microsoft, uses GitHub + PRs):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change: the entire change I want to check into the codebase this can be multiple commits but it’s what I’m putting up for review</li>
  <li>Commit: a portion of my change</li>
  <li>Patch: a group of commits or a change I want to use on another repo/branch</li>
  <li>Revision: An id for a group of commits or a single commit</li>
</ul>

<p>P5 (big tech, uses GitHub + PRs):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change: your update to source files in a repository</li>
  <li>Commit: description of change</li>
  <li>Patch: I don’t really use this but I would think a quick fix (image, imports, other small changes etc)</li>
  <li>Revision: some number or set of numbers corresponding to change</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>

<p>Take-aways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change: People largely don’t think of a “change” as an physical object, rather just a diff or abstract object.
    <ul>
      <li>It can potentially range from uncommitted to committed to pushed (P1–P5).</li>
      <li>Unlike others, P4 thinks of it as a <em>larger</em> unit than a commit (more like a “review”), probably due to the GitHub PR workflow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commit: Universally, commits are considered to have messages. However, the interpretation of a commit as a <em>snapshot</em> vs <em>diff</em> appears to be implicit (compare P2’s “commit” vs “revision”).</li>
  <li>Patch: Split between interpretations:
    <ul>
      <li>Either it represents a <em>diff</em> between two versions of the code (P2, P3).</li>
      <li>Or it’s a higher-level interpretation of a patch as a <em>transmissible change</em>. Particularly for getting a change from someone else (P1), but can also refer to a change that you want to use on a different branch (P4).</li>
      <li>P5 merely considers a “patch” to be a “small fix”, which is also a generally accepted meaning, although a little imprecise in terms of source control (refers to the <em>intention</em> of the patch, rather than the mechanics of the patch itself).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Revision: This is really interesting. The underlying mental models are very different, but the semantic implications end up aligning, more so than for the term “commit”!
    <ul>
      <li>P1: Not a specific source control term, just “the effect of revising”.</li>
      <li>P2, P3: Effect of “applying all commits”. This implies that they consider “commits” as <em>diffs</em> and “revisions” as <em>snapshots</em>.</li>
      <li>P4, P5, Some notions that it’s specifically the <em>identifier</em> of a change/commit. It’s something that you can reference or send to others.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly to me, P2–P5 actually all essentially agree that “revision” means a <em>snapshot</em> of the codebase. The mental models are quite different (“accumulation of diffs” vs “stable identifier”) but they refer to the same ultimate result: a specific state of the codebase (…or a way to refer to it — what’s in a name?). This is essentially the opposite of “commit”, where everyone <em>thinks</em> that they agree on what they are, but they’re actually split — roughly evenly? — into <em>snapshot</em> vs <em>diff</em> mental models.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Conclusions for <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj">jj</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We already knew that “change” is a difficult term, syntactically speaking. It’s also now apparent that it’s semantically unclear. Only P4 thought of it as a “reviewable unit”, which would probably most closely match the jj interpretation. We should switch away from this term.</li>
  <li>People are largely settled on what “commits” are in the ways that we thought.
    <ul>
      <li>There are two main mental models, where participants appear to implicitly consider them to be either snapshots or diffs, as we know.</li>
      <li>They <em>have</em> to have messages according to participants (unlike in jj, where a commit/change may not yet have a message).
        <ul>
          <li>It’s possible this is an artifact of the Git mental model, rather than fundamental. We don’t see a lot of confusion when we tell people “your commits can have empty messages”.</li>
          <li>I think the real implication is that the set of changes is packaged/finalized into <em>one unit</em>, as opposed to “changes”, which might be in flux or not properly packaged into one unit for publishing/sharing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Half of respondents think that “patch” primarily refers to a <em>diff</em>, while half think that it refers to a <em>transmissible change</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>In my opinion, the “transmissible change” interpretation aligns most closely with jj changes at present. In particular, you put those up for review and people can download them.</li>
      <li>I also think the “diff” interpretation aligns with jj interpretation (as you can rebase patches around, and the semantic content of the patch doesn’t change); however, there is a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/968932220549103686/1187096737639321742">great deal of discussion on Discord</a> suggesting that people think of “patches” as immutable, and this doesn’t match the jj semantics where you can rebase them around (IIUC).</li>
      <li>Overall, I think “patch” is still the best term we have as a replacement for jj “changes” (unless somebody can propose a better one), and it’s clear that we should move away from “change” as a term.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“Revision” is much more semantically clear than I thought it was. This means that we can adopt/coopt the existing term and ascribe the specific “snapshot” meaning that we do today.
    <ul>
      <li>We already <em>do</em> use “revision” in many places, most notably “revsets”. For consistency, we likely want to standardize “revision” instead of “commit” as a term.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
