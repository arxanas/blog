## TODO: title

In big tech, it's common to get an initial compensation package that includes a fixed number of [restricted stock units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_stock) (RSUs) which vests over time.

<p class="note-block">
<span class="note-tag">Furthermore:</span>
Some big tech companies also issue "refresher" grants to current employees, either as part of normal performance review or on a case-by-case basis.
</p>

<p class="note-block note-warning">
<span class="note-tag note-warning">Not including:</span> Companies that set a fixed <em>dollar</em> amount and pay you in an equivalent number of shares upon vesting, rather than setting a fixed number of shares up-front.
</p>

One question is: what's the ideal ratio of salary to RSUs in such a compensation package?

From a financial perspective, being granted $100k in RSUs as part of an initial compensation package is similar to borrowing $100k at a 0% interest rate and investing it in the company's stock, then divesting over time as the RSUs vest (<span class="note-block"><span class="note">At least in principle:</span> you'll have the opportunity to divest by selling, although you may choose not to.</span>).
