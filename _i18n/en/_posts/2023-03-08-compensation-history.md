## Compensation history

Some others have [shared their compensation in the software engineering market](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/09/09/public-salary-history/). For the same reasons, I'm making mine available [at this Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1agEtwxcpS0HB8HSJJjy2u6wIUbi5LFUQMAus4ADu7mU/edit?usp=sharing). I consider this information somewhat sensitive, so you'll have to request access.

In the [trimodal salary model](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/), having worked in the US in [big tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) and now finance, I rank well into "tier 3". Thus, this information is most useful for those negotiating with tier 3 companies.

- In big tech, compensation is usually awarded in the form of salary, stock ([RSUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_stock)), and a yearly performance-based bonus.
- In finance, compensation is usually awarded in the form of salary and a yearly performance-based bonus.
