_Intended audience: software engineers working with Git who happen to come across this value and want to confirm that it has particular significance._

The hash `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391` is used by Git to indicate an empty blob (an empty file).

To verify this, we can construct the object content manually and hash it. The format for object contents is `<type> <size>\0<contents>` (where `\0` denotes the [null byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character)). In this case, the type is `blob` and the size is `0`, and there are no contents. We can compute the hash with one of the following commands:

```sh
$ printf 'blob 0\0' | shasum
e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391  -

$ printf 'blob 0\0' | openssl dgst -sha1  
e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391
```
